# Fun little bash scripts
It's all in the name baby! 

This repository is a collection of fun little (mostly) bash scripts that were too small to be their own repository, but too cool not to share. You already know your bash scripts, not it's time to slay the command line in style. Literally.

## :ribbon: Frame your output :ribbon:
A selection of different frames to yassify your terminal output! Whether youâ€™re showing off your latest code, debugging like a boss, or just want to make your terminal look extra, this is for you. 

This was not tested on outputs longer than one line, so use at your own risk!

## :checkered_flag: Checkered terminal :checkered_flag:
Not all scripts have to be serious. Hope you have fun with adding some colour to your terminal from time to time.

I have named the colours `COL1` and `COL2` so you can easily change those to whichever colours you want.
